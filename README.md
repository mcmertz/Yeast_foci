# W_NucleiSegmentation-Cellpose

2D nuclei segmentation using Cellpose (https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) and the pre-trained nuclei segmentation models of Cellpose.

Cellpose method and model are described in the preprint "Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.02.931238).
